There are two teams operating in the same environment (using the same map).
Each team has a flag and tries to find and steal the opponent’s flag.
Implement the following two tasks.
    (1) Exploration:  the  team  of  robots  needs  to  explore  the  map  to  gather  information
        (e.g.,using formation control, leader-follower, or area coverage)
    (2) protect the flag:  the team protects  their  flag  from  adversarial  attacks
        (e.g.,  using  formation  control  or  cyclic  pursuit).Show the implemented strategies
        for the two tasks in simulation (modeling the opponents is not required).

You are free to design the map/environment.

Extensions: Implement a decoy strategy to steal the flag (e.g., using formation control, leader-follower).
